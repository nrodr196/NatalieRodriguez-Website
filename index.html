        <div class="subheading mb-5"> Neuroscience üìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I created a club called the Autism Awareness Club during my Junior year of high school. I am in my third year of being the founder and president of my club and have taught many of my peers about so many disorders and disabilities and have impacted many of my friends to be more knowledgeable and have a better understanding of disabilities; specifically Autism Spectrum Disorder. I am currently working with another club in my school supporting kids with special needs and helping them with daily tasks. I am very passionate about my club and I feel eternally grateful that I can be the person my peers go to when they want to know more about disabilities. The reason I created my club is for my brothers, both of them have Autism and other related disorders. They are the loves of my life and I'm willing to do anything for them to make sure they are safe and well. Throughout my life, my brothers would always get judged or made fun of for the way they acted in public, and as a little girl, I didn't really know how to stand up for them or speak up; I made this club so people could understand my brothers and people like them. Although there has been a rise in diagnosis of Autism and other similar disorders, there are still many people in this world who don‚Äôt understand Autism and the disorders that overlap with this condition. Autism Awareness Club is a club of over 10 students who meet four times a month in our thirty-minute lunch period every Wednesday and meet for an additional Tuesday thirty-minute lunch period where we discuss what topics will be mentioned during the Wednesday meeting. I work with two other council members who work with me to make the presentations for the club where we discuss a different disorder each week. As a future neurologist, I want to be well informed in order to educate others.  I have aspirations for my club continuing at UC Riverside  so more people can be aware. I want to be able to educate as many people as I possibly can and high school was a great start for that. The impacts that I‚Äôve made in high school have changed me into becoming a better person which I hope to improve on day by day. I am a pre-med student and through my accomplishments I‚Äôve made in this club, I know that the clubs in colleges will be perfect for me to pursue awareness for Autistic people. I am so happy I have found like-minded people at UC Riverside who share the same sense of protecting and teaching others so people can understand this condition before they judge or assume. I want to protect and will be protecting people‚Äôs voices so they can feel comfortable in their day to day life. I will continue this motivation to pursue equality for people with special needs as I continue with my journey throughout life. <br><br>

        As one of my biggest accomplishments, I‚Äôve been in the theater council for two years and I was the historian for all the social media platforms of the club throughout my senior year of high school. I‚Äôve been in theater since my freshman year and fell in love with theater since taking Theater Combat and Acting. I‚Äôve always loved musicals since I was little but didn‚Äôt get into theater until high school. I have been a part of four productions and currently in two productions going on right now, which is our Halloween show and our Fall Play. I am an International Thespian and have received an award from the California Educational Theatre Organization as a part of the runners crew in ‚ÄúThe Outsiders‚Äù production as a backstage manager during my junior year. Throughout my senior year of high school, I also received one of the highest achieving ranks which was the ‚ÄúInternational Honor Thespian‚Äù which means I am recognized throughout the entire world for my dedication in Theater. I feel honored that I was a part of this high school and I hope to pursue this passion of mine at UC Riverside. I have always admired the productions that have been done on campus and in the IE area and I can‚Äôt wait to be a part of and see productions in the future.In the four productions I‚Äôve done, I have helped direct one of them. I‚Äôve been in every part of every theater production I‚Äôve done. For example, The ‚ÄúHigh School Musical Jr.‚Äù production is where I first started acting on stage. I started as a stage manager but one Saturday rehearsal led to the director of the show loving my performance so much, I became an extra character created two weeks bef0re the show and I performed for the rallies, middle school performance, vignettes, and one show night.  I was so excited to try something new and I‚Äôm so happy because it brought new experiences and challenges to my identity. Theater brought me out of my comfort zone and helped me with public speaking. Improv taught me how to think quicker and respond to another person in that moment. Improv taught me how to think outside the box and bring my own personality into any character. I‚Äôm grateful that theater has built my confidence over my four years in high school and it has made me into who I am today. Theater has opened many doors for me and I wish to encourage others to have these experiences in the fine arts as well so they can open up from their fears. Public Speaking is the number 1 fear in the world which is very surprising when it‚Äôs compared to other fears such as spiders or heights. The fear can be reduced in people the more they participate in public performances to explore themselves and help them get over fears because it is way more common than we actually think. I am so grateful to Theater and I hope to continue being part of these hard-working productions in school. <br><br>

          What I would say is my greatest skill is that I am bilingual and in the process of being trilingual. I am fluent in English and Spanish and am currently learning Arabic. My first language is Spanish and I grew up speaking it because my father was an immigrant. My father didn‚Äôt know how to speak English so I focused on becoming fluent in both languages so that I wouldn‚Äôt have a language barrier with my father. Over time, I didn‚Äôt have to worry about the language barrier anymore because my father became a US citizen and became fluent in English . Throughout my life, I helped my father with his English and taught him more words and phrases as time went by. My father works at a gas station where his co-workers are of Egyptian descent. They have taught him the Arabic language and is now fluent.  Today, my father knows several languages and he is the person who is teaching me Arabic. This skill has allowed me to connect with more people. My dad is one of the hardest working people to ever exist and has been one of my biggest motivations to learn and work for the things in life. As a latina in medicine, I plan on using this skill so I can better serve my patients. There will not be a language barrier between my patients and I, such as my father had with my brother‚Äôs neurologist. I am happy to serve diverse populations and I am excited to learn more languages. As a pre-med student, I hope to learn as many languages as I possibly can to make my environment as comfortable as I can for my patients. I practice daily on learning my Arabic and soon hope to start other languages such as Japanese, Portuguese, and etc. I believe language holds a significant place in our cultural identity and it just means so much to me to be as inclusive as I can for my patients. I would not want to shy away from the opportunity to grow and learn as a person when I start to have experiences with patients and getting to know them and their story. Since my specialty will be the brain, it is very important for patients to get the right diagnosis and treatment so they can improve their lifestyle so they can live to their full potential. I also plan to increase the number of latinos in medicine which is about 6% in the country which I believe needs to change and I plan to change it by becoming a latino in medicine, but also as a woman in STEM. There are also not enough women in the medical field as physicians and I want to change it by being the first in my family to become a doctor. I know the journey will not be easy but I have aspirations to help my community which I love so much and I appreciate how much it has done for me!
